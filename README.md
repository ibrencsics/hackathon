# Hyperledger for Public Education and Job Certificates


## Story

Jane has finished university and is now applying for her first job. At the interview 
the interviewer would like to check her bachelor certificate. Instead of passing
a piece of paper, Jane passes her key which allows the interviewer to check the 
validity and details of her certificate like grade and the main subjects executed 
as part of her exams. 

If Jane gets accepted for the job further records may be added to certify job
qualifications and activities. This may include further education certificates issued
by permissioned organisations and the employer to testify job activities Jane has 
performed as part of her career.

## Rationale

Certificates on paper may be faked or get lost. Keeping certificates on hyperledger
provides for a single point of truth where the credentials are kept. Privacy is 
assured as no one can read Jane's records without her consent, i.e. without an one-time
key Jane will generate for the requestor.
