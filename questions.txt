Business problem
- need for verification of degrees etc.

Why Blockchain?
- a lot of enterprises and universities need to check degrees/certs
    --> distriuted ledger
- important data
    --> trust
- exchange of valid certificates through different educational systems

Where to sell?
- first: enterprises

Read ops recent or historical?
- recent + historical
    --> need to look for alle degrees a person has
    --> time consuming but necessary
    --> query solution can't be implemented yet

Are there other solutions already?
- yes
    --> but without Blockchain
    --> no well-known solutions
    --> just small approaches

Did you consider privacy
- data can't be inspected without the owner's permission

Future work
- Query search implementation (queries did not work as expected and need more work)
- Nicer demo, e.g. using QR codes for certificate UIDs
- Refine Use Cases, consider legal (e.g. GDPR) and regulatrory aspects
- Review ongoing activities on the subjects, e.g, standardization activities
